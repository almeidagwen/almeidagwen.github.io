              <h2>1949</h2>
              <p>The first big adaptation of The Great Gatsby came in 1949 as a movie from Paramount Pictures, just as the book was becoming more popular. This film isn't as accurate to the book's plot as later adaptationsâ€”it focuses more on Gatsby's criminal enterprises.</p>

              <h2>1974</h2>
              <p>The 1974 movie version of The Great Gatsby was Hollywood's second attempt at adapting the novel. This is a faithful adaptation of the book with beautiful sets, costumes, and some good performances.</p>

              <h2>2000</h2>
              <p>This movie is somewhat accurate, but because of its shorter run time, there are some cuts to the plot. It's very fast-pacedIt and also has a few odd additions. This film also has much lower production values since it was made for TV.</p>

                <img src="images/2013.jpg" alt="The Great Gatsby 2013 movie">
              <h2>2013</h2>
              <p>This one is likely the Gatsby movie you are most familiar with. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, this Gatsby has the eye-popping visuals, dancing scenes, high energy and big production values his movies are known for. However, there are some pretty big plot diversions here and some visuals are too over the top.</p>
