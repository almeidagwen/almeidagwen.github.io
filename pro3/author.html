               <p>Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on September 24, 1896. Writer and novelist, he is famous for his depictions of the Jazz Age (the 1920s), his most brilliant novel being The Great Gatsby (1925). Fitzgerald received critical acclaim only after his death and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.</p>
